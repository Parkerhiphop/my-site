(Might have minor spoilers, but basically to extent guessable from name, please exercise discretion!)

Although following text talks about quite a few melancholic things, but it is still a very warm work!

It is very touching. Don't worry it is a work that will make you very Emo after watching. If it does, I think it is also a good time to let yourself settle, go take care of those surging emotions and memories!

"We said goodbye, always thought there would be next time, unaware that this meeting was last time for each other"

"Often thought there is next time, but this time is last time for each other"

"We are destined to meet most friends for last time without both sides knowing"

We said goodbye, always thought there would be next time, unaware that this meeting was last time for each other.

"Robot Dreams" tells about loneliness, love and companionship. Briefly passed over impermanence based on human nature. At same time gave song <September> by Earth, Wind & Fire new meaning again. Making this song a song capable of celebrating past joy and also speaking for melancholy behind love and companionship.

I think, "Robot Dreams" is also a farewell to old friends and old lovers who once spent good times together.

We all have been changed by another person valued incomparably. No matter that person is lover or old friend, he or she was like whole world at that time. And we inevitably welcome new lifestyles. Each other will eventually separate due to some factors. But that beauty didn't disappear, but became a part of you recognized by others. Just like that song <September> is already favorite golden song of \_\_\_\_ at end.

Impact "Robot Dreams" gave me is very similar to "La La Land" and Minoru Furuya's "Ciguetera". Telling best times once spent, but this doesn't mean current times are not beautiful. But under basis of "now", that melancholic feeling that each other can no longer go back to past.

Next is feeling of very lonely very lonely. From trailer can see protagonist is a dog living alone, microwaving bento eating with boring TV programs.

Driven by such loneliness, Dog ordered "Amigo Robot" following advertisement. And this robot faithfully became his good friend, showing a warm smile accompanying Dog living. Like lyrics of <September>: "Do you remember? The 21st night of September. Love was changing the minds of pretenders. While chasing the clouds away".

Regarding why Dog chose robot to accompany, movie also explained in detail. Can only say heartbreaking and real. Believe many people (including me) can empathize. Being able to feel this is even more distressing.

Most amazing thing is, "Robot Dreams" finished telling this 102-minute story without saying any single word.

(Below are some personal thoughts touched in life)

Saw a film review wrote, "Sometimes we don't 'watch' movies but 'need' movies". I think this is it. "Robot Dreams" is movie I need. I lived very painfully these few years after entering society. Should say I have been very painful since starting university. After successfully switching career to software engineer, pain is even doubling every year.

There are many reasons. Like after I started university slowly found my family is abnormal. Resources given by my family really can't compare with classmates around. After working found my talent, effort and luck also inferior to people around. But these are not point this time. Point is due to despair of these "can't compare" and "I am not good enough" almost crushed me, making me unable to interact with friends around purely like before. I also can no longer dance. Thus bringing loss of friends accumulated in seven years of dancing before graduation. Because life circles, values and things thinking about are all different. We slowly have nothing to say. Or say I also don't have spare energy (in time and psychology) to interact with these old friends.

I first lost most friends in street dance circle. Then many friends made during university period. Some are also I actively or unilaterally let go (Mainly in psychology, or refusing some invitations).

Recently I let go of more friends again. Some are really friends once very good. But I think that time has passed. And life continues to move forward. Inevitably will hold more such melancholy.

At this time, really thank this movie "Robot Dreams". It acted out too much helplessness. I think my current stage is just like that helplessness Robot encountered on beach at end. There will be a period broken. And repair needs to take some time. Also might rely on some external forces.

Of course among these helplessness there are fleeting beauties. Like Miss Duck and nesting mother bird in play. I accept with gratitude. At same time feel slight apology towards past.

Finally might also act like Robot in front of window!

Coincidentally, actually when buying movie ticket, I saw a friend from long ago queuing in front of me. But I chose not to call her. I found she seemed to be waiting for someone. I think we just let life return to two parallel lines, live current life well is enough.

If curious what I am describing, go watch "Robot Dreams" quickly!

(In addition, personally prefer original name Robot Dreams more. Dreams are part most inducing laughter, most beautiful and moving and also most heartbreaking of whole work.)
