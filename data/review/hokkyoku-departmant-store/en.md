## Thoughts

Really like watching this kind of heartwarming work without too much scheming recently.

At the same time, also like how many Japanese works observe and present interaction process between people so meticulously.

From eyes of concierge Akino of department store, it presented Japan's respectful service attitude of treating customers as priority. But compared to superficial politeness, I think what author wanted to present more is Akino's sincerity of thinking for customers behind, wanting to let everyone have a happy shopping experience here.

## Plot

Tells a world where animals are anthropomorphized living together with humans. Besides appearance, animals are no different from humans inside. Can communicate with humans, also shop, dress up, make desserts and engage in art. In such a world, there is a department store called "Hokkyoku Department Store". Staff are all humans, customers are all animals, mostly V.I.A (Very Important Animals). True meaning about this name will be gradually revealed along plot.

Protagonist of work Akino visited Hokkyoku Department Store when she was little, since then had longing for working here. Plot focuses on Akino entering this department store as she wished, some workplace little stories happening between first day and passing probation. As customers are all animals, workplace appearance that can be presented is also richer.

## Production

There is original manga. This theatrical version is produced by Production I.G. Smoothness of animation really goes without saying. Physical movements of characters and moving ways of different animals are really very meticulous. At the same time, characters are almost all voiced by big-name voice actors (There are Jun Fukuyama, Kenjiro Tsuda, Kana Hanazawa etc.). Their voices make emotions of whole movie very abundant.

## Couldn't Stop Crying Watching

I was surprised myself, but thought about it later, it is because emotions are portrayed very sincerely. I am easily moved by that mood of really wanting to do a thing well.

In this movie can see Akino really treats this job very seriously. She takes every suggestion given by supervisor and colleagues seriously. Her supervisors and colleagues are also leading her very seriously and carefully.

I think this movie presented an ideal: An ideal working environment, ideal colleagues, ideal supervisor, ideal work attitude. And I actually want to believe such place exists.

Although just a fictional work with fantasy elements, I am still very moved that such world can be portrayed. Have a feeling of "Ah! So someone is thinking same thing as me! So possibilities I imagined not only exist in my mind! I am not alone!".

Really no matter if possible in reality, just knowing someone also imagines like this, even materialized it into a work, and this work is done so well, I am very satisfied and happy.

## Spoiler Thoughts

Although main axis described many moving little stories, finally on Christmas day, ending with two events of "breaking ice sculpture" and "choosing gift for bedridden customer" is very moving, but actually world view of this movie is very cruel and realistic. Because these appeared animals are almost all extinct, or endangered creatures. And reasons why these creatures are endangered are nothing more than places where humans can profit from, Sea Mink, Caribbean Monk Seal, Japanese Wolf etc. This is exactly true meaning of the term V.I.A. Why only humans interact in this department store, is to let people serve these animals hunted to extinction.

Therefore at first glance it is workplace daily life, but actually also portraying these extinct animals, letting them continue to be remembered by people. Also hope to let readers know what humans once did to them. Occasionally also smuggle some little knowledge about these animals in plot.

## Miscellaneous Thoughts Unrelated to Plot

Watching this movie also made me confirm my writing motivation and goal again. I know world is full of malice, heard quite a few related stories, also experienced some things myself, but I still want to try my best to describe goodness of humans, or describe goodness that can still be seen when facing these malice.

I want to let people feel through my words that they are not alone. Many things are not only experienced by individuals, but common experiences under era and culture and environment. And we are all seeking answers in this. Me in this era, this place and encountering these things, at least can record things I saw, I felt, as testimony to myself. Also might be able to connect, dialogue with others through words.

Of course, there will definitely be many things that can be criticized by future me or people of next generation, just like we are also gradually carrying out political correctness cleansing on works of previous generation. But premise of being re-examined is being written, recorded. I want to try to write more, record more.
