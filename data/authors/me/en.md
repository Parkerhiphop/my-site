Hi, I am Parker!

A software engineer with a background in philosophy. I initially struggled with impostor syndrome, but as I coded more and learned more, I gained a lot of satisfaction from solving problems, participating in community events, and teaching.

I enjoy sharing and believe in the magic of words, which is why I created the website. While I hope my thoughts can benefit others, I find that the person who gains the most from my writing is me.

My hobbies include reading novels, comics, watching anime, and movies. My favorite author is Brandon Sanderson('Mistborn' series). I have too many favorite anime to list. My lifelong idol is Airi Suzuki.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy my articles. Feel free to contact me through any channel listed at the bottom of the website.
