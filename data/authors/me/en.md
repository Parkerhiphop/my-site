Hi, I am Parker!

A software engineer with philosophy background. Fighting with the imposter syndrome at first. However, while I coding more and learning more, I get lots of accomplishments from solving problems, attending community events and teaching.

I enjoy sharing, believe the magic of words. That's why I created the website. I hope my thoughts can benefit others, but I find that the person who gains the most from my writing is me.

My hobbies are reading novels, comics, animations, and movies. My favorite author is Brandon Sanderson(Mistborn series). My favorite anime is ...too many to list. My lifelong idol is Airi Suzuki.

Anyway, I hope you like my articles. Welcome to contact me through any channel on the bottom of the website.
