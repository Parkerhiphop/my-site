As a software engineer who graduated from the Department of Philosophy, I struggled with impostor syndrome for the first three years of my career.

However, as I became more familiar with the field, I began to appreciate the joy of programming.

Writing a program feels like turning imagination into reality. I experience a sense of accomplishment when the program executes according to my vision.

I'm passionate about sharing and communication and believe strongly in the power of community. I appreciate the collaborative spirit of open-source software, where the entire community progresses together.

I enjoy writing articles, using words as a medium to communicate with people and myself across time and space. While I hope my thoughts can benefit others, I find that the person who gains the most from my writing is me.

I'm also a fan of stories and consume novels, comics, animations, and movies. My favorite author is Brandon Sanderson, known for the 'Mistborn' series, and my most recent favorite is Kotaro Isaka.

My lifelong idol is Airi Suzuki.
