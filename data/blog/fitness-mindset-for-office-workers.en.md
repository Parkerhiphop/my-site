summary: 我作為一個上班族如何打造健身習慣的方法論跟心態
---

As an office worker who hasn't exercised much since graduating from college, I used to struggle with maintaining a gym routine. I would usually give up after a month at the most. Working remotely for a period only exacerbated the issue, with my physical activity dipping to less than 2,000 steps a day.

However, I've recently managed to establish a long-term workout habit, and the change in my physique has been quite noticeable. Today, I want to share with you my journey, focusing on "methodology" and "mindset".

## Methodology

### 1. Location, Location, Location.

> What's the best gym? The one closest to your home or office.

**The starting point for wanting to exercise is transport, not the gym itself**

Making it as easy as possible to exercise is the key to forming a habit. This ties into the concept of "environment" from Atomic Habits, rather than relying solely on willpower.

### 2. The Two-Minute Rule

> Start with just doing, then aim for doing well. Standardize before you optimize.

This rule, also from Atomic Habits, suggests condensing a new habit down to "two minutes". The ==key is to make it as easy as possible to start==. With regards to fitness, this means not aiming for too heavy or too much. You can just do two sets at the gym. Being able to sustain the habit is what matters the most.

New habits should not feel like a challenge. They can become challenging later, but in the ==beginning, they should be easy==. Repetition is more important than perfection, so just keep going!

### 3. Push Through the Valley of the Beginner

According to the Learning Curve theory, initial progress can be slow and difficult. But as we keep investing effort and gaining experience, learning efficiency increases and the progress curve steepens. I call this initial phase the "Valley of the Beginner".

In fitness, you will face this Valley of the Beginner too. At first, you might not know what you're doing and might not feel or see much difference. But once you get past this stage and start receiving feedback, a virtuous cycle will begin.

### 4. Leverage the Power of Community

I often share my workouts at the gym on social media. Responses from people around me, such as likes or comments like "Strong, fierce, huge, looking good" act as psychological motivators to keep me going. When I see my friends posting about their workouts, it often motivates me to go exercise the next day.

### 5. Habit Tracking

Keeping a record of what you do each time can help remind you of how far you've come and how long you've been going. This applies the Paper Clip Strategy from Atomic Habits. I keep a list of my workouts, ticking them off as I complete each one. The satisfaction of ticking things off the list helps me maintain the habit.

### 6. Compound Exercises > Isolation Exercises

For office workers, we usually don't have much time for exercise. Hence, choosing compound exercises, which work multiple muscle groups at once, can be more efficient than isolation exercises.

If you follow the common workout plan of focusing on "chest, back, legs", and only train once or twice a week, each body part only gets trained once every week or two weeks. This is not enough stimulation, and the results might not meet your expectations.

> Note: This is not against isolation exercises. It's just from the perspective of "low training frequency", compound exercises can better stimulate all body parts.

As for the training schedule, I incorporate two sets for chest, back, and legs in each workout. You can design your own schedule. A single schedule should last at least three months, during which you can gradually increase the weight of each exercise.

## Mindset

### 1. Don't Beat Yourself Up When You Miss a Day

Sometimes, work or other factors may prevent you from working out. The key is not to give up entirely because of one missed session. Missing one session doesn't mean you've failed. It's crucial to get back on track immediately.

Every missed session should be seen as an independent event. It's not the first mistake that ruins you, but the repeated ones. After every mistake, stop the losses and get back on track.

> The point is not the act itself, but becoming the person who won't miss the act.

### 2. Find Your Exercise Identity

Finding an exercise identity that suits you is key to maintaining the habit. This could be for longevity, to have enough energy to explore the world, or to stay healthy and keep learning and growing. I personally enjoy the challenges and training of "Spartan".

Moreover, we shouldn't be tied down by numbers. Since March, I've only lost four kilograms, but many people think I look healthier, and my muscle definition is more noticeable. However, I am still 8 kilograms away from the normal BMI, so physique and feeling matter more.

### 3. Do I need to take class?
