This is an article mixing travelogue and recent mood.

Thought about the title for a long time. Just happened to read Taiyo Matsumoto's new work "Tokyo Higoro" (Tokyo Days) recently, decided to pay tribute in the title.

Went to Tokyo for a quick three-day trip at the beginning of the month. Because after Aimer's Asian tour ended last June, followed the atmosphere and immediately drew tickets for this year's Tokyo tour in March.

But as the date got closer, I wanted to go out less and less. Mainly because too many trivial matters to deal with in daily life and too many uncertain situations emerged. Thoughts were occupied. I didn't even have margin to arrange itinerary.

After struggling for a while, decided to arrange a three-day quick trip to Tokyo. Until the day of departure, I was still holding vexing things, always worrying about a bunch of things not done yet.

Result was after coming here found out how much I needed these three days.

## Vast Sky and Ocean

Leaving original environment for a bit, don't need too much, just three days, can get rid of foul atmosphere shrouding me. Coming for this **feels like instantly sober and pupils dilated after taking a cold shower**.

I just discovered I haven't opened my eyes properly recently, only maintaining state of being able to see. Jaw was also clenched tightly all the time. After relaxing here found both sides of chin very sore.

Since I didn't bring computer, many things couldn't be handled. So I was **liberated from urgency of jumping to handle problems immediately upon encountering them**.

Since I started working, haven't left computer for more than two days. Whether going abroad or domestic travel, if more than one day I will bring computer. Even if I might not be using it, as long as carrying computer I will feel at ease.

Thinking now, **that was not sense of security, but close to sense of fear. I worried as long as I didn't hold computer, I would be unable to handle any possible accidents**.

didn't bring computer this time only to find, actually many things are not so urgent, or not necessarily have to be me.

Steps on the road in these three days became very light, because didn't carry macbook weighing nearly three kilograms.

After returning to hotel can also go to sleep directly after washing. Because can't open computer to use anymore. Actually not necessarily have things to handle, but as long as computer is opened there are infinite things can do. Can check email, scroll social media, read some unfinished articles, write a little code. Most afraid is falling into any stage, like seeing someone responded to my committed code on github, seeing issues want to discuss (quarrel) on social media etc.

Maybe reason as software engineer, without computer makes me feel like a person without ability. But exactly because of this incompetent state, I can detach to look at life again.

I withdrew from problem after problem to be handled. Moved sight away from those problems. I looked forward, upward, left, right. Suddenly a doubt arose in heart, "**Does scenery around always extend infinitely to distance like this? Does sky always have no end like this?**"

Remembered a novel "Elegant Yokai Apartment Life" read in junior high school. Protagonist moved into apartment where humans and yokai live together after life encountered huge change. Inside there is a character Mr. Ryu admired by everyone. When protagonist was working part-time crazily, studying and trying hard to change current life, Mr. Ryu said "**Your life is still very long, world is also incomparably broad, relax a little**".

This plain and simple sentence, I remembered until now. On the road of Tokyo, this sentence also emerged in my heart several times.

After returning to Taiwan, my life didn't change much. Things and problems annoying me before leaving were not solved either. But I didn't feel that cloud shrouding feeling before going out anymore. I possess another way to look at these problems. I can also choose to push aside those clouds shrouding me. Maybe wait until I can't push aside again next time, it is time to give myself another three days.

## Tsubame-yu

![tsubame-yu.png](/life/tokyo-three-days/tsubame-yu.png)

Although I consider myself not afraid of cold, still couldn't bear Tokyo temperature of only one degree felt once getting off plane. So immediately started to check if there is bathhouse open in morning after exiting customs. Later found "Tsubame-yu" located in Ueno.

Quite surprised when entering. Because very similar to bathhouse protagonist goes to daily in movie "Perfect Days". Later also found this is Japanese registered tangible cultural property.

Process of bathing is putting shoes at entrance, taking corresponding number tag to enter. Once opening door can see entire bathhouse. There is a 180-degree counter inside collecting entrance fee. Like a small observation tower can directly see male and female baths. When I went in it was an auntie, but heard sometimes it will be an uncle.

Basically won't have any greeting and introduction. Although saw many tourism articles writing about this bathhouse, here needs to be able to communicate in Japanese better to come.

There are also many regular customers inside. On top of storage area also many washbasins put by regular customers, with their towels and bathing equipment on top.

Also saw combination of suspected sports class students and teacher coming in to bathe.

I also accidentally used soap of an uncle. Luckily he very kindly taught me how to get stool and body wash.

Maybe also inspired by same movie, felt very calm feeling here. Washing body, entering bath, doing nothing, just existing there.

## Hachinoki

A very Japanese style hot pot / sukiyaki (nonsense here is Japan). Quite delicious but portion not large.

Traveling alone sometimes feel a bit awkward to eat yakiniku or sukiyaki. But clerk didn't say anything when filling one person during reservation at door. Later also very kindly led me to seat. Let me sit at four-person seat alone. Clerk seeing my foreign face also kindly introduced how to eat (but I actually didn't understand, later still cooked randomly).

Heard clerk chatting with a regular customer in Chinese when paying bill. Heard accent felt like Taiwanese. But I didn't summon courage to speak Chinese with her. Later still used Japanese to communicate with her.

## Oyokogawa Water Park Kawazu Sakura

Came to Japan many times. First time seeing cherry blossoms in full bloom.

Flowering period of cherry blossoms is really hard to guess. But happened to see friend in Tokyo shared cherry blossom viewing spot. Also happened Ginza sony park I originally wanted to go wasn't reserved. Also happened to be very close to Tokyo Garden Theater where I wanted to watch concert. Just like this under multiple coincidences, successfully viewed cherry blossoms in early spring of early March.

I am a person not very good at taking photos can take such photos. Shows really very beautiful.

## Friends

This paragraph was not written when sending newsletter. Hesitated for a night still wrote in. Felt still want to record briefly.

Found two friends just went to Tokyo very temporarily this time. One holding student visa, one holding work visa. Met them to chat about thoughts staying in Tokyo for a few months. Feedbacks got were all positive. One preparing to start studying spatial design. One already found job ready to switch to formal work visa when I was writing article. Really feel happy for them. Seeing people with same goal (going to Japan) realizing one after another, also encouraged myself. Hope I can also follow their steps in near future.

Thank one of them took me to eat beef tongue in Shinjuku. Another accompanied me to check in cafe in Shibuya, stroll Tower Records and "Konno Hachimangu Shrine" in Shibuya city.

Even earlier when went to Tokyo chatted with some friends already lived there for several years. Their lives in Tokyo are becoming more and more stable. Already started permanent residence process. Originally very afraid I will have no friends going to Japan later. But I think currently already have these people as guarantee. Maybe don't need to worry so much!

## Aimer

Finally chat about reason for this quick trip.

![aimer.png](/life/tokyo-three-days/aimer.png)

I really like atmosphere of Japanese concerts. Especially Japan tours will design themes. Venue layout, lighting and song selection are all related to theme. This is hard to experience in Taiwan. But also some singers coming to Taiwan unexpectedly show another side also like very much.

Aimer's theme this time "Michelieu" (Waning and Waxing of Moon). Main visual revolves around moon phase. Huge moon and starry sky projection behind. Moon will wax and wane.

Very touched listening to MC this time. Although now only verify remember to live on to meet again. But many people around me heard crying.

Excerpt a little note seen on social media:

"Moon Shadow" is song made for this tour.

"Sign" whenever hearing this song again, please remember today's performance, is our promise.

"Grace Note" we came to this world alone, will also leave alone. But this is absolutely not a bad thing. Exactly because of music let us gather together.

I think, being able to hear these warm songs live, staying with fans who also appreciate such warm songs together, this trip is worth it.
