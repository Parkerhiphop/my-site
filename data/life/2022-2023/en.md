Continuing the method from last year, I made some adjustments this year, using the following key items and thoughts to review.

Why review in March?

- Even if last year was a mess, I still want to leave a trace. Writing it down is like taking a snapshot of myself at that time.
- I believe the future me will definitely thank the current me for writing it down, just like I am very grateful that the 2021 me did a review.

TOC

1. Annual Goals
2. Achievements, Milestones
3. Three Most Valuable Lessons
4. Three Best Decisions
5. Three Best Books
6. The Person Who Influenced Me the Most

Things not posted include "Happy Things", "People and Things to Thank", and "Cool Stuff", etc.

### Annual Goals

Honestly, I don't remember, so this year can be said to be a mess. The only thing I remember is wanting to work in Japan, but I must say I didn't work hard enough at all.

### Achievements, Milestones

#### 1. Living in Japan for a month and a half

Successfully fulfilled the wish of playing passionately while young (also fulfilled the dream of envying others going on exchange during college)

Next, I hope to go abroad directly for work.

#### 2. Passed JLPT N3

Just passed by one point above the passing score.

#### 3. Lost 8 kg with a coach at the end of the year

- Gained 3 kg back after returning from abroad

#### 4. Dared to speak English more and more, and completed two English interviews

#### 5. More mature financially and mentally

1. Coaching classes, Japanese classes, going abroad
2. Able to cope with the accident of the company closing down
3. Not craving relationships so much, able to live relatively comfortably by myself

### Three Most Valuable Lessons

> _Looking closely, the first two points are the same as 2021. It seems that one year is not enough to make me learn._

> _Therefore, I am also grateful to myself for recording last year, so I can know how much I have moved forward. If I am marking time, I must change other ways to improve the current situation._

#### Time, Time, Time.

- Start with myself
- Prioritize things properly
- Currently most hope to accumulate hard skills and learn Japanese well, but have not been investing time in it
- Before the career is stable, overly invested in writing, anime, and self-media (actually achieved little)
- Don't just find someone to accompany because of loneliness — previously it was love, this year it is friendship
- Mainly roommates, secondary are a bunch of casual acquaintance meals that consume me

#### Social media hurts me more than I imagined

There really isn't anything very important that must be said by me or by 2023. Before taking good care of myself, let's not think about what I can do for others.

- Don't rush to say, let yourself become substantial first

I really don't care that much about everyone's daily life, and often too lazy to reply. Maybe it's also because I haven't taken good care of myself.

When I am not very satisfied with my life, I keep receiving overly decorated positive messages.

Unconsciously picking it up to scroll, too much low-quality social interaction on it, and it makes me spend too much time replying to messages and posting updates.

I believe in my social skills. On this trip to Japan, I also found that interaction between people still requires face-to-face interaction. Social media is just a means for us to keep in touch.

It makes more sense for me to use the time managing social media to write my own weekly journal, systematically organizing and reviewing my thoughts.

#### Knowing is easy, doing is hard

- "Premise on myself", "Reduce recording, increase reflection", "Sleep early", "Stable practice of Japanese and English", "Regular exercise", "Priorities", etc.
- As mentioned above, concepts I knew from the beginning of the year or even 2021, the road between "knowing → doing" is very long, but I know I am moving forward steadily, so don't rush.

### Three Best Decisions

1. One and a half months of independent travel in Japan
2. Participating in the Spartan Race
3. Participating in the Line Webtoon script contest

### Three Best Books

I read too few books this year QQ, but if I were to say

1. Four Thousand Weeks
2. Gray Thinking
3. Isaka Kotaro's books (currently like Fish Story the most)

### 5 People Who Influenced You the Most

1. RK: Mutual stimulation in writing, encouraged me to write since 2021, and invited me to a small writing group, allowing me to regain my forgotten dream.
2. KT: The words he writes from time to time, his attitude towards writing and dreams, and his way of life all stimulate me. At the same time, he is a very powerful person worth learning from in all aspects.
3. OM: His love and achievement for what he does, although overall giving me malignant pressure, is also someone who constantly stimulates me to improve and gives me deeper and broader thinking.
4. BY: He never limits himself, spins a cocoon around himself, dares to dream, and this trait also got him many unexpected opportunities. Although luck plays a heavy role, I believe this trait makes him luckier.
5. Y: Brought me a lot of connections. Participating in his gatherings always teaches me a lot, giving me a lot of reflection on how to use my resources to achieve what I want to do.

### Things That Made Me Painful This Year

#### Physique

- Improved after hiring a coach.

#### Loneliness

- Perhaps feeling lonely in the dead of night, but we will never be alone.
- Made quite a few bad choices due to loneliness, such as agreeing to attend gatherings too often, putting aside things I should do.

#### Peer Anxiety

- Most problems are not "not enough", but not having more than others.
- This mindset needs to be dealt with this year.

#### Spending too much time on creation, not taking care of the main job and the plan to go to Japan

- Discovered at work that I am actually not suitable for WFH
- Japanese learning steps never stabilized

#### Continuously suffering from social media, many updates make me unhappy

- Still too easily influenced by others

#### Renewing the lease on the rental place was a bad decision

- The room has no windows, poor ventilation, and nothing to eat around
- Sound insulation is too poor (sounds of cars passing by are too obvious)

> _2023/03 All the above pains have found solutions and adjustments, thumbs up._

### Reflecting on 2022

> _Comfortable, relaxed but painful. For a 24–25 year old, it is not an ideal lifestyle._

2022 was not a very good year to pass. I really lived very unhappily. 80% of the time I was struggling and suffering from various things. Some were worrying about nothing, some were things one wouldn't know without experiencing.

2021 was in "transition", 2022 is still "transitioning"!

But indeed, it opened up many possibilities and tried a lot of things. It was a year of knowing myself better.

I started writing seriously, participated in the webtoon writer contest held by Line WEBTOON, and found friends to write with.

I started exercising seriously, taking A-Ji's Muay Thai class, A-Guan's coaching class, doing physical therapy, taking Senior JoJo's fitness knowledge class, and starting to take responsibility for my physique and health. (Mainly because I was scared when I got fat to 80 kg in the middle of the year)

I started preparing for my dream, learning Japanese seriously, practicing English. I've been talking about liking Japan for so long, finally started.

Finally, I started facing my career squarely.

The most regrettable thing in 2022 is that I still spent too much time on unworthy people and things. This is not negative, it's just that our paths are different, or those things are not helpful to the direction I want to move forward, just wearing down my time.

In 2023, I want to be more seriously aware of the people and things that are important to me.

My life has always been too easily taken away by others' rhythm, and I have set too many imaginary enemies in my heart.

This year I finally realized that I don't need to accept that information. Choosing not to compare with them is not escaping, but focusing more on myself and being responsible for myself more thoroughly.

### About 2023

Looking at the 2022 review above might feel very negative, but actually, I have also figured out a lot of things and am no longer hesitant.

Using "Introduction, Development, Transition, Conclusion", 2019 and before was "Introduction", 2019 ~ 2021 was "Transition", 2022 was "Development", I hope 2023 can be "Conclusion". Converging past pain, accumulation, and growth, letting resources fall into place, mindset positioned, more firmly on my own dream, moving forward steadfastly!

#### Work

Achieved the stage goal, changed a job (actually because the previous company suddenly closed down haha)

- Currently feel that the degree of freedom is high, there are many things to try, CTO has high EQ and strong technical skills.
- Although the treatment cannot be compared with many people around me, reviewing it, I did grow year by year and did not stop.
- If comparing, it really never ends, but having only been in society for a few years, let's focus on self-growth and mental health first!

#### Interpersonal Relationships

- In various big and small matters, I can recognize that there are many friends around me who care about me very much, and I also feel love.
- But life is short, we cannot afford to waste time on the wrong people. Hope to allow myself to have the spare energy to accompany important people.
- For relationships, love yourself first before you can love others, but this year I feel I can be a bit more active.

#### Health

- Still a fat otaku currently, but gradually established exercise habits last year, and less resistant to weight training.
- Participated in a comprehensive transformation plan in March, from physical training, nutritional management, and living habits, there have been great changes. If continuing at this pace, quite looking forward to my future self.

#### Finance

- Resumed the habit of bookkeeping since the middle of last year, and roughly understood my consumption habits. Aiming to start asset allocation and possess passive income this year.

#### Dream

- JLPT at least N2
- Stable writing

> _The overall goal is to make myself a person with more "Yuyu" (margin/spare energy)._

Taking "having margin" to pay for dreams as the goal of 2023. Step by step, after all, I don't have that capital to chase dreams too early. I chased briefly in 2022 and was convinced that all aspects (body, mind, spirit, material) were not in place yet. But I believe as long as I keep it in mind and don't give up, the dream will be there waiting for me to realize it.

- Actually, economically achieved a little bit. Going abroad for a month and a half and the company suddenly closed down, almost didn't have to worry about expenses. Feeling touched to go from not having enough food to having this margin.

> Finally, 2023 GOGOGO!!!
