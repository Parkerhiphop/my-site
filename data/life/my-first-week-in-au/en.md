Unknowingly have lived in Gold Coast for a week. Taking advantage of memory and impact still fresh to record.

This week I actually didn't do much. Went to various supermarkets to buy supplies with friends in the first two days. Two days looking up information and running administrative processes (mobile phone, bank, TFN, TMR etc.). Weekend two days went to BroadBeach and Surfers Paradise to see the sea by myself. Then at night usually playing Maplestory with friends in Taiwan.

Although the title says first week in Australia, actually still quite a lot of my own thoughts. If want to see thoughts more related to Australia can scroll directly to the "Miscellaneous Thoughts on Australia" section below!

(If really want to see information related to Australian Working Holiday, other backpackers' experiences should be more detailed.)

## Only Realized Taiwan is Hometown After Leaving

Saying goodbye to more and more people, becoming more and more attached to Taiwan.

Because my Facebook was blocked for a period of time, almost missed the wedding of a dance club senior who is both a teacher and a friend, just two days before my departure.

Met many old friends at the wedding. Mainly seniors from high school and university dance clubs. Really took care of me a lot. Really happy to see them before leaving. Among them a senior sister who took care of me very much, when sharing with her that I was about to depart, felt a bit nasal. Finally when saying goodbye to the senior, didn't expect he cried first. He said "Have a feeling that won't see me until a long long time later", then I also cried together.

After my house lease ended, I no longer have a place called "home" in Taiwan. So I had to leave things I can't take away at friends' house. Thank two friends willing to lend me space, and listened to me sharing the meaning of these things to me. After introducing these items once, I felt ready to bid a short farewell to these items. Things I own combined are also a little proof of my existence.

From ending lease to leaving Taiwan, I stayed at friends' house for a week. Originally they gave me a farewell once when I wasn't going to stay. After moving in gave another farewell. Quite funny but also quite heartwarming.

Wrote an article before departure and thought deeply. Currently very dissatisfied with Taiwan in work, living, traffic and original family etc. But there are so many beautiful people in Taiwan, supporting me, helping me. Kindness they gave me, repeatedly made me feel should stay to work hard, build a better Taiwan.

Can't truly hate Taiwan, also because Taiwan gave birth to these people.

Luckily my flight ticket and visa were ready before seeing everyone, otherwise I would really waver.

However after calming down a bit here, still feel I really need to come out for a trip. I burned myself out a bit.

(Also thank everyone who gave me blessings after seeing [Leaving Taiwan for Two Years: Heading to Australia and Japan](https://www.parkerchang.life/life/leaving-taiwan-working-holiday). Even if didn't meet, I am also very grateful to everyone willing to move fingers to bless me.)

### Maybe the Last Time

Before this departure, tried to arrange meeting with friends who asked.

Heard from Gooaye (podcast) before saying "**Unknowingly we met many people for the last time**". Not necessarily related to life and death, but fate just ends here. All along, indeed have quite a few experiences saying let's meet next time, but silently there is no next gathering.

As age grows, some people will get married and have children, some people will shoulder more responsibilities at work, and other increasing external affairs. If I confirm not settling in Taiwan later, then time I can find friends when coming back will be even less.

So, before this departure I cherished every gathering with the mood of the last time. Of course still hope everyone can be well wherever they are.

## Here to Heal

Thinking of when sharing my plan with a senior, he said "Looks like you were severely heartbroken by Taiwan".

Even if I have been here for a week, I still only have negative thoughts about Taiwan. Described most in the article of temporary farewell. Rest of thoughts not sure if extreme won't repeat here.

If want to respond to friends' blessings, what I should do is not stay in Taiwan to struggle, but find ways to let myself continue in any form.

The day after I left Taiwan, my dad happened to bring his wife and kid back to Taiwan from China. The night I saw photo of my dad's family gathering with other relatives, I had a nightmare.

That dream was very ordinary, just dreaming I was at the scene. But just me being at the scene felt very panicked.

At this time I knew, how unwilling I am to see them again. How fortunate I am to leave Taiwan one day earlier.

I really want to cut off relationship with him, but I am too weak. I can't do it yet. I also don't have courage to tell him I don't want to see him.

I can only choose to leave Taiwan temporarily. I won't step on China's land either. Hope I can become braver in these two years.

## Can't See the Truth Because Being In It

Counting from resignation time, I haven't written code for nearly two weeks. In my six years of work, first time didn't write code for more than three days.

Although haven't started working in Australia, feeling very uncomfortable thinking of returning to Taiwan's software engineer environment. Taiwan companies like to transfer cost of career development and growth to employees themselves too much. I worry about not being needed anymore after work and on holidays. Feel life is pressed to breathlessness but can't see direction.

I slowly figured out in this week. My previous efforts might not be on the point. I think my efforts have two big problems. One is **effort degree not good enough to jump to better environment**. Two is **direction of effort is not to escape environment, but keep finding things to learn due to FOMO**.

In annual review of [2023 → 2024](https://www.parkerchang.life/life/2023-2024#%E4%B8%8D%E7%9B%B2%E5%BE%9E%E6%BD%AE%E6%B5%81), slightly realized "don't blindly follow trend". But seems as long as I still stay in original environment, writing code at work every day, thinking of ways to improve myself after work in anxious state, will forever stay at "knowing", but "can't do".

Thank leafwind for sharing the golden sentence, "Not getting rid of terrible environment, continuing to study to enhance ability, will only get more tiring work. So studying in extra time can only be for leaving terrible environment".

This also reminds me of blood test before going abroad. Only then knew my body lacks Vitamin D. But health supplements I ate in this half year were Vitamin B and C. This feeling of futility is like my career in these few years.

Don't know if I will continue to go back to write code, but just continue to observe and try in these two years!

## Haven't Started Working

Since this trip was arranged very suddenly. Decided on 5/25, resigned on 6/30, ended lease on 7/03, departed on 7/08.

So I only started to look up information and find job after arriving in Australia. Also thank friend for letting me stay, so I can spend the first week more relaxedly. I was also very lucky to bring everything needed (rather brought too much).

My original plan was buying a second-hand car first, then find job, finally find accommodation based on job.

It is really inconvenient without a car in Australia. And second-hand cars here can buy quite good ones around 100k TWD. Almost can sell to other backpackers at original price before leaving. So decided resolutely to buy a car.

But Australia's regulations on driving license and vehicle transfer are different in each state. I probably checked for two afternoons to figure out what to do.

International driving license issued by Taiwan supervision office is useless. Need English driving license translated by NATTI matching Taiwan driving license to use here. I asked Watson and A-Xi, this WH self-media to help me translate online.

Gold Coast where I stay currently is in Queensland. Queensland needs CRN (Customer Reference Number) to complete vehicle transfer. I have to run to local supervision station (TMR), and provide "passport, two bank cards with name (can be Taiwan's) and proof of address".

Proof of address needs lease or utility bill etc. other documents with my name, to prove I live in Queensland. So buying car has to wait after I rent house myself.

I am not sure what type I will do, where to do. Therefore dare not to rent house rashly. I still have time for second visa after coming back from Japan. So might find some hard labor or remote work that can collect visa days to do for 88 days to qualify for second visa first. During this period also look up information, know more people, see what can do.

## Miscellaneous Thoughts on Australia

Finally still use to share interesting discoveries in Australia currently!

1. Australia is really huge. Still feel huge after mental preparation.
2. Weather is really good. Big sun every day. And not many high-rise buildings in Gold Coast. Always can see blue sky.
3. Australians like small talk very much. Passers-by or staff starting move is "Hey, How is going?".
4. People on road have super many tattoos. And tattooed areas are very large. Many people with neck and limbs covered with tattoos. But not like Taiwan's full arm tattoo that will be colored. Just all black or dark tattoos.
5. People met currently are all friendly (clerks, supervision station, bank). Really just dare to speak, trying to convey, they will try their best to understand my meaning. Speaking English here will become more and more confident. Won't worry about accent and intonation. Because there are all kinds of races (many Indians). Basically as long as can communicate.
6. Australian English has super many abbreviations! Like afternoon is arvo, registration becomes rego.
7. Part of Gold Coast matching its name is BroadBeach and Surfers Paradise, these two big beaches. Usually still a bunch of trees on road. Then super many amusement parks!
8. Super many people told me to be careful of Taiwanese. Almost every friend who has been to Australia told me so. Employers would be black-hearted. Landlords would have high proportion of bad landlords. Others include being cheated of money etc. Current thought is can't let down guard just because fellow countrymen.
9. Traffic heaven. Cars seeing me preparing to wait for road, will stop directly. Cars in both directions will! Then traffic lights are all button pressed by self.
10. Here also has shared bikes, called Lime. But super expensive! Almost 500 TWD for half an hour.
11. Eating out is really expensive. Eating roughly full also needs 20 AUD (about 400 TWD). Drinks are also expensive. Average almost 200 TWD. So I formed habit of drinking effervescent tablets this week.
12. Thai, Chinese and Japanese cuisines are quite a lot. Daily food seems to be burgers and seafood. Ate for a week feel Taiwan's eating out wins completely.
13. SouthPort has a Hechalou. Taste same as Taiwan. Clerk is also Taiwanese.
14. Many delicious milkshakes here! I like milkshakes super much! Krispy Kreme here even has milkshake that throws desired donut directly in to blend!

That's it for now! Share again if have thoughts later. Not necessarily have second week XD
